# Steam Link Bluetooth Controller
Steam link Bluetooth controller. Support for keyboard mouse and gamepad
Gamepad is currently in development.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to create a support keyboard, mouse and gamepad to help with steamk link user interaction. The app is to be developed to android in a first initial release and the communication is featured via bluetooth. No need to buy additional mouse, keyboard or second gamepad. No need to always move the peripherals arround. The bluetooth data transfer was chosen because the steam link supports bluetooth. Given that, in some conditions useres might not have wireless connection due to distance reasons. However, bluetooth will always be close to the players becuase a proper close quarters interactions is needed with steam link.

## Setup
This project works also for other linux based distributions, as long as they support Bluetooth.
In the following chapter I will show how to install in SteamLink and Ubuntu.
